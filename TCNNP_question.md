# TCNNP question

the TCNNp model is rather similar to the FNNP, consisting two parts: privatizer and adversary. There is no question regarding adversary part since it's pre-trained.

However, how can I include the concantenate process (combine privatizer result and original image) in the overall GAP structure?
